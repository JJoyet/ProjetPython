To launch the game, simply execute the file game.py in the "ProjetPython" folder.
At the beginning of the game you will be asked the number of players, if they are AIs and the name of each player. You will also be asked to indicate the youngest player.
Each player is assigned a role in each round, if your role is "C" you are a digger and you must reach the gold among the three endings, if your role is "S" you are a saboteur and you must prevent the diggers from reaching the gold.
